>
> Dr. SiPz was a mud of many talents, but he wanted to merge them into one ultimate project: a universe configuration that could modify the lower levels of Solana Blvd's ecosystem and the surrounding communities. He knew that he needed to find like-minded beings to help him spread the word, but he wasn't sure where to start.
>

The drug would transform those who sipped from the double cup, changing communities and bringing value to Solana Blvd. However, Dr. SiPz didn't fully trust random beings to distribute the drug. Be begin to search for someone that he could collabrate with to test out the drug, There was one The went by MsDenver of Women Cafe NFT.

After a couple moths of not talking to MsDenver. she moved on to bigger things. But blessed Dr. SiPz with making a idea to create being from samples from Women's Cafe. He came up with (Women's Muddy) a beings that wasn't fully tested. They spread the word but the potent version of this state wasn't strong enough.&#x20;

But the scientist had to cut the supply's to 2000 from 3333. By doing this he can lock in the small followers and do test samples to the first batch. In this process he will ask his followers to dump the bad (burn) for the a series of different samples.
