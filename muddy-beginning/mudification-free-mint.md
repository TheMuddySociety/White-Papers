**GitBook tip:** A succinct video overview is a great way to introduce folks to your product. Embed a Loom, Vimeo or YouTube video and you're good to go! We love this video from the fine folks at Loom as a perfect example of a succinct feature overview.

## Modification / Mudification

The Muddy Society: Modification / Mudification   &#x20;

1. &#x20;to our community by constantly improving our offerings. As part of this commitment, we are pleased to announce that we will be implementing a new art style to enhance the overall aesthetic of our project.
2.

    This new art style will be exclusively available as a free mint to our WL holders or MuddyOg roles, who will obtain our tokens to mint. Moreover, during the modification process, we will be launching a token campaign where those who burn their tokens will earn the opportunity to participate in the upcoming 10.5 million $SLABz airdrop, which can be used towards the minting of the one million $SLABz project.
3.

    We are proud to share that we will be implementing a revenue share model, where 70% of the revenue generated will be distributed to our holders, while the remaining 20% will be allocated to the main project. Additionally, we will be offering a limited number of NFT grants to WL holders, with a maximum limit of 10 grantees. These unique projects will serve different purposes and offer exclusive perks to the main project's holders.
4.

    As music artists, we are excited to announce that some of the 1/1s in our collection will feature music singles and music videos, providing our community with a truly unique and engaging experience. These key gems will be included in each collection under the Muddy Family, and our WL holders and MuddyOg roles will have access to these exclusive offerings at a discounted mint price of 0.65 sol (compared to the starting price of 1 sol)
